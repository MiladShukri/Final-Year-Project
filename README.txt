Game Balancing - Theory and Practice
------------------------------------


Project file contents:
----------------------

	 Executable game (folder name: "FPS Simulation")
	 Code base/ unity folder (folder name: "MiladShukri_17025470_Project")
	 README.txt

Software required to run the project file contents:
--------------------------------------------------

- Unity 2019.2.0b1 or later to open code base

- Visual studio 2017 or later

Start-Up Guide:
--------------

To open the game click on the "FPS Simulation" folder then you should see an application
called "MiladShukri_17025470_Project" double click this to start the game.

To access the source code exit the "FPS Simulation" folder and click on the "MiladShukri_17025470_Project" folder then you want
to open the file "MiladShukri_17025470_Project.sln" in visual studio. Once it is open in visual
studio use the solution explorer and click the drop down for "Assets" and then click the drop
down for "Scripts" and all of the c# scripts that were created should be there.

To open the application through unity, open a new file in unity or on the unity hub and find the main folder "MiladShukri_17025470_Project"
this should then open it so you can access all the work from the unity editor.

Description:
------------

For this project i have constructed a First-Person shooter simulation where you have to
kill 10 zombies on 5 levels. On each level the zombies variables are modified to effect
the balance of the game. After completing the levels there is a survey to fill out that
will assist me in gathering data for the report. The change of balance in these levels 
should have an effect on the experience that players have and it's important that we measure 
that with the data we gather.

Level Structure:
----------------

10 Zombies on each level
Same map on each level

Level-1: Zombies should be quite simple for most people to finish the level.

Level-2: Zombies deal more damage which means it takes less hits to defeat you.

Level-3: Zombies have more health so it takes more shots to defeat them.

Level-4: Zombies movement speed is faster which cuts down the amount of time you have to deal with the zombie.

Level-5: Zombies have had all 3 variables increased at the same time to make the level considerably more difficult.
